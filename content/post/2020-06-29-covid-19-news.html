<p>I recently read a newspaper headline that read <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-and-some-other-states-see-coronavirus-cases-rise-11591540411?shareToken=st8ed170060eaf4b31aa5852c0d23e3691">“California and Some Other States See Coronavirus Cases Rise”</a> and thought “I already knew that!” This was because I had been dabbling with the data to make my own plots.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is that data-based reporting has moved to the fore.
Nonetheless, I often find the reporting inadequate, not because it’s bad, but because what I am interested in understanding isn’t necessarily what is being reported.</p>
<p>But, with a modicum of data skills, it is easy to do your own reporting.
For example, the New York Times provides COVID-19 data by state <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/">here</a>.
And <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus"><em>Our World in Data</em></a> has extensive data on COVID-19 around the world.</p>
<p>The two key data variables are <em>cases</em> and <em>deaths</em>. As a measure of progress of the pandemic, cases are a more timely statistic than deaths (and also a little less morbid), but there are by-now-well-understood issues with cases, such as under-reporting due to lack of symptoms, or symptoms insufficiently serious to lead to hospitalization or testing. As pointed out in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-and-some-other-states-see-coronavirus-cases-rise-11591540411?shareToken=st8ed170060eaf4b31aa5852c0d23e3691">the <em>WSJ</em> article</a> linked to above, as testing capacity increases, we might expect to see a rise in reported cases, even if the underlying number of cases is flat.</p>

<h2>Getting the data</h2>
<p>Getting the data is quite easy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
library(RcppRoll)

raw &lt;- read_csv(paste0(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&quot;,
                       &quot;nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv&quot;))

covid_states &lt;-
  raw %&gt;%
  group_by(state) %&gt;%
  arrange(date) %&gt;%
  mutate(new_cases = cases - lag(cases),
         new_deaths = deaths - lag(deaths)) %&gt;%
  rename(total_deaths = deaths,
         total_cases = cases)</code></pre>
<p>Initially, I wanted to consider Australia as a US state for the purpose of comparison. For the US, I focused on a few states of interest: New York was the worst-hit state, Massachusetts is where I am now, and California is the most populous state. Pennsylvania provides an interesting comparison for Massachusetts. Apart from Australia, I also considered the United Kingdom, which was hit at about the same time as New York.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selected_states &lt;- c(&quot;Florida&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot; , &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Georgia&quot;)

  covid_states %&gt;%
  filter(state %in% selected_states)</code></pre>
<div id="cases" class="section level3">
<h3>Cases</h3>
<p>One thing I noticed initially was a definite lumpiness to the data (e.g., many more deaths on Tuesdays rather than Sundays in Pennsylvania), which I assume is down to reporting rather than actual events. Initially, I used a four-day moving average, but here I use a seven-day moving average (as the four-day one still showed clean peaks and valleys).</p>

  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(breaks = &quot;4 weeks&quot;, date_minor_breaks = &quot;1 week&quot;)</code></pre>
